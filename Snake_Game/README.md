# 🐍 Snake Game

A classic Snake game built using Python and the `turtle` module.

## 🎮 How to Play

- Use the **arrow keys** to control the snake:
  - ⬆️ Up - Move Up
  - ⬇️ Down - Move Down
  - ⬅️ Left - Move Left
  - ➡️ Right - Move Right
- The objective is to **eat the red food** to grow your snake.
- Avoid colliding with the **walls** or **your own tail** to keep playing.
- The game **ends** when you hit a wall or yourself.
